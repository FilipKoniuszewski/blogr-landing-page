                            Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive
                            interface which lets you focus on one thing:
                            creating content. The editor supports management
                            of multiple blogs and allows easy manipulation of
                            embeds such as images, videos, and Markdown.
                            Extensibility with plugins and themes provide
                            easy ways to add functionality or change the
                            looks of a blog.

                            sections, format, or flow. With this functionality,
